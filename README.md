# Sports Betting Bot Project

**Project Overview**  
This project focuses on automating and enhancing sports betting strategies, particularly for baseball and potentially other sports. The aim is to use Python to gather and analyze sports data, identify favorable betting opportunities, and create a structured approach to sports betting with machine learning models and data analysis.

### Betting Types Overview
1. **Moneyline**: Simple bet on which team will win the game.
2. **Spread**: Bet on how much a team will win by (e.g., Yankees need to win by more than 1.5 runs).
3. **Totals (Over/Under)**: Bet on whether the combined score will go over or under a set number.
4. **Prop Bets**: Specific bets like player stats (e.g., will a player hit a home run?).
5. **Parlays**: Combining multiple bets for higher potential payouts but more risk.

### Data Gathering & Analysis
- **Player/Team Stats**: Collect stats such as batting averages, pitcher records, and team performance.
- **Advanced Stats**: Analyze deeper metrics like WAR (Wins Above Replacement) or OPS (On-Base + Slugging Percentage).
- **Historical Game Outcomes**: Use historical data to predict likely future outcomes.
  
**APIs for Data**:
- **SportsDataIO**
- **OddsAPI**
- **Baseball Savant**

### Bot Development with Python
1. **Data Scraping**: Use Python to scrape betting odds and team/player data from APIs or websites.
2. **Machine Learning Models**: Train models to predict outcomes using libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `statsmodels`.
3. **Automated Betting**: The bot will alert or automatically place bets based on favorable conditions.

**Key Libraries**:
- `pandas`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`

### Betting Strategies
- **Moneyline Strategy**: Focus on betting on favorites or underdogs based on advanced stats and historical matchups.
- **Prop Bets Strategy**: Use player stats to predict individual performance (e.g., how many home runs).
- **Arbitrage Betting**: Find differences in odds between multiple bookmakers to ensure profit.
- **In-Game Betting**: Bet on real-time game events, like the next inning or player performance during a game.

---

### Bankroll Management
Manage your bankroll responsibly to ensure long-term success:
- **Percentage Betting**: Bet no more than 1-2% of your total bankroll per bet.
- **Kelly Criterion**: Adjust your bets based on your confidence level and potential value.

### File Structure
Here’s an example file structure for organizing the project:

```

│
├── scripts/
│   └── data_scraper.py
│   └── odds_analyzer.py

    └── moneyline_strategy.md
    └── prop_bets_strategy.md
```

Let me know what you think, and we can adjust this as you dive deeper into the project!

That structure is intended to be concise, clear, and actionable, setting the foundation for your bot project. Feel free to save it as a **README.md** file or tweak it to fit your specific goals!
